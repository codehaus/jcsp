<P>Point and click the applet to start the countdown.  Further clicks
toggle between <i>holding</i> and <i>countdown</i> modes.
When the countdown reaches zero, the status changes to <i>fired</i>
and the <i>abort</i> button is disabled.
After 10 seconds, the countdown restarts from its initial value with
the <i>abort</i> button re-enabled.

<P>In countdown and holding modes, the <i>abort</i> button may be pressed.
This cancels the countdown and puts the system into <i>aborted</i> mode.
After 10 seconds, the countdown restarts from its initial value with
the <i>abort</i> button re-enabled.

<P>When in the 10 second <i>fired</i> or <i>aborted</i> modes, mouse clicks
toggle between that mode and <i>holding</i>.

<P><i>IMPORTANT</i>: if the abort button is pressed at the same time as the countdown
reaches zero and control tries to fire the rocket, it's important the system resolves
this command clash cleanly.  In particular, the system must not deadlock nor
get into a corrupt state!  <i>Exercise</i>: prove this system is free from these hazards.
<i>Hint</i>: use CSP.
