<p>The sliders control the speed of the animations to their right.  Initially,
they are in the bottom position which represents a speed of zero (and consumes
no processor resource).  Clicking on an animation panel reverses the order of
the sequence of frames being dusplayed.

<p>JCSP concurrency makes this type of control very easy ...
