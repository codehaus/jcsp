This package contains the files specifically for the
JCSP.NET Channel Name Service (CNS).
A CNS provides a broker service, enabling distributed JCSP processes
to set up communications with each other.
Networked channels have names.
Currently, networked channels are automatically <i>Any-One</i>.
The reading process is responsible for creating the channel and
(optionally) registering it with a CNS with some unique (to the CNS)
name.  Writing processes need to know (or be told) the name of
a networked channel to connect to it by the CNS.
Communications between networked writers and reader then proceed
directly (independent from the CNS).

and <code>{@link org.jcsp.net.cns.CNSService}</code>
