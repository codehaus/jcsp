This provides CSP extensions for all AWT {@link java.awt.Component} components:
GUI events and widget configurations map to channel communications.
<P>
Each AWT component (e.g. {@link java.awt.Button}) is mirrored by an <I>active</I>
{@link org.jcsp.lang.CSProcess process} (e.g. {@link org.jcsp.awt.ActiveButton})
that works to a channel interface.  GUI events are signalled as output
messages sent on channels coming from the CSP component.  Each component
may be dynamically configured by sending it a message on its configuration
channel.
<P>
The JCSP-AWT components may be wired up to any (JCSP) application network.
This allows a safe and natural approach to GUI building as a (multi-threaded)
network of communicating processes.
