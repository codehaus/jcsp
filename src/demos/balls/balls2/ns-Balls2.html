<p>This applet demonstrates some simple concurrent animation.&nbsp; Each
ball is a process writing to its own slot of a shared <i>display channel</i>
(<tt>jcsp.awt.DisplayList)</tt>, whose other end is serviced by a <tt>jcsp.awt.ActiveCanvas</tt>.&nbsp;
There are no GUI controls, but the number of balls in the display is specified
by the applet <i>balls</i> parameter and their speed (movements per second)
by <i>speed</i>.&nbsp; Each ball has its own (random) colour, starting
position, size and initial direction vector.
<p>Useful extensions to this applet would be: GUI controls for adjusting
temperature (i.e. speed) and displaying pressure (i.e. bounces per second
off the walls), changing the size of the containment canvas, zapping existing
balls and adding new ones, varying the mass and size of the balls, freezing
and resuming the animation, collision detection and bouncing, adding resistance
to motion and gravity, ...
