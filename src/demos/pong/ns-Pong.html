Left player controls:&nbsp; A = [UP] Z = [DOWN]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right player controls:&nbsp; K = [UP] M = [DOWN]</h3></center>
There are 3 paddle move speeds.&nbsp; Tapping [UP] from stationery starts
the paddle moving upwards.&nbsp; A second [UP] increases the speed and
a third [UP] gets maximum speed.&nbsp; Tapping [DOWN] reverses this process.&nbsp;
Tapping [DOWN] from stationery starts the paddle moving downwards and so
on.&nbsp; The paddles slowly shrink in size ... but will grow back.&nbsp;
Watch out for the wobbles that occasionally strike.
<p>Scoring.&nbsp; You win points for hitting balls and lose them (but not
so many) for missing.&nbsp; Faster moving balls carry more points (in relation
to the square of the speed).&nbsp; The size, shape and colour of the balls
do not matter (in this version).&nbsp; Can you keep your score positive?
<p>Bad eyesight?&nbsp; Then, keep the mouse pointer outside the playing
area!
<p>Keystrokes being ignored?&nbsp; Sometimes keyboard focus gets lost,
even though the browser window is highlighted.&nbsp; Move the mouse pointer
into (or out from) the playing area to force a regain of focus ...
